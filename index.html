        <p>Hello, my name is Alex Codori and I'm from Bolivia. I enjoy reading books about personal growth and
            psychology. I have a
            deep desire to make a difference in people's lives, which is why I would like to learn more about software
            development
            to create a website for learning English. I also love running in the mornings, and I'm striving to maintain
            good health,
            eat healthy, and be disciplined.</p>

        <img src="images/potosi.webp" alt="Potosi">
        <p>Cerro Rico, also known as the "Rich Mountain," is a legendary silver mountain located in Potosí, Bolivia.
            During the Spanish colonial period, it was the world's largest source of silver, fueling the Spanish economy
            for centuries.
            The mountain stands at 4,782 meters (15,689 ft) above sea level and has been continuously mined since the
            16th century,
            earning Potosí the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tragically, millions of indigenous workers
            andAfrican
            slaves perished in the harsh mining conditions, leading to the saying that the mountain was made of "silver
            and blood."
            Today, while silver deposits are largely depleted, mining continues for other minerals like zinc and tin,
            though the mountain's structural integrity has been compromised by centuries of extensive tunneling.</p>
