        <p>My name is Alex Condori and I am from Bolivia. I enjoy reading books about personal growth and psychology. I
            have a deep desire to make a difference in people's lives, which is why I want to learn software development
            to create an English learning website. I also love running in the mornings and strive to maintain good
            health through discipline and healthy eating.</p>

        <p>Cerro Rico, also known as the Rich Mountain, is a legendary silver mountain located in Potosi, Bolivia.
            During the Spanish colonial period, it was the world's largest source of silver. The mountain stands at
            4,782 meters above sea level and has been continuously mined since the 16th century. Today, mining continues
            for other minerals like zinc and tin.</p>
